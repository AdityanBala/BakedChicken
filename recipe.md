Step 1: Brine
To brine chicken, simply fill a big bowl with lukewarm (not hot) water.  Stir in a handful of salt until it mostly dissolves.  Then add your chicken breasts and let them sit in the saltwater to brine for at least 15 minutes.  If you are doing this in advance, you can cover and refrigerate the bowl of chicken and saltwater for up to 6 hours.
When you’re ready to go, remove the chicken from the brine.  Give it a good rinse it with cold water to wash off the salt.

Step 2: Brush
Brush your chicken breasts with melted butter.

Optional Step:
Put slices some potato and onion into the baking bowl if you wish to add a side dish

Step 3: Roast!
If you are using thick pieces then bake for 30 minutes at 350°F, but if you are using smaller pieces and want a crispy crust bake for 15 to 18 minutes at 450°F

Step 4: Enjoy!
